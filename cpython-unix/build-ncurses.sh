# The terminfo database exists as a set of standalone files. The absolute
# paths to these files need to be hardcoded into the binary at build time.
#
# Since our final distributions are "relocatable," the absolute path of the
# terminfo database can't be known at build time: there needs to be something
# that sniffs for well-known directories and attempts to locate it. Ideally
# that could find the terminfo database that we ship!
#
# All is not lost, however.
#
# On macOS, the system terminfo database location is well known: /usr/share/terminfo.
#
# On Linux, common distributions tend to place the terminfo database in only a
# few well-known locations. We define default search paths that overlap with
# Debian and RedHat distros. This often results in at least a partially working
# terminfo lookup in most Linux environments.
#
# configure appears to use --with-default-terminfo-dir for both a) where to
# install the terminfo database to b) default TERMINFO value compiled into the
# binary. So we provide a suitable runtime value and then move files at install
# time.
